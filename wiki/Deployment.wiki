#summary How to deploy hardware configuration and application on the NEEK

You may deploy preliminary built hardware configuration and application on the NEEK.
To do this you may download files [http://neek-klondike.googlecode.com/files/neek_niosII_video_time_limited.sof neek_niosII_video_time_limited.sof] and [http://neek-klondike.googlecode.com/files/klondike.elf klondike.elf].

Firstly, configure FPGA:
	# Run *Nios II Command Shell*
	# Execute next command `nios2-configure-sof neek_niosII_video_time_limited.sof`
	# You will be prompted to quit, but do not do this if configuration is the time limited.

Secondly, download the application:
	# Run another instance of *Nios II Command Shell*
	# Execute next command `nios2-download klondike.elf --go`

Also, if required, you may run `nios2-terminal` before downloading application.
It allows you to see messages about errors, which appears during application executing.
